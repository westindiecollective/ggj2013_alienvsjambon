This crazy game was developped in a mere few hours during the last sleepless night of the Global Game Jam 2013.
This isn't an official submitted game as it doesn't use the GGJ 2013 theme in anyway :)


Controls:
- keyboard arrows to move / jump
- mouse left button to fire
- mouse cursor to affect aiming


To run the game "Alien VS Jambon", you need to run the web content from a webserver / httpserver.

If you don't have one locally or remotely, you can install easily a command line http-server:

1) install node.js:
http://nodejs.org/download/ (which gets you the npm command)

2) run the following command line (in Windows command or Mac OSX / Linux terminal):
'npm install http-server -g'


Then to run the game, from the folder containing index.html, run the command: 'http-server'
It starts the http-server locally on port 8080.

You can now play the game in your favorite web browser after you enter the local adress:
'localhost:8080'

Enjoy!
